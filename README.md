## Project: A neural network project to predict GIT semistability for binary n-forms. 

## Description: A binary n-form is a homogeneous n degree polynomial in 2 variables x and y. It is called GIT semistable iff no root repeats > n/2 times. Here roots are considered as points in the projective line. We consider both the case of fixed degree polynomials (in particular n=4) as well as the case of different degrees (in particular n=2,...,8). We run a deterministic method to count the multiplicity of roots and then train a neural network on a data set of suitably chosen polynomials.
